# NotesInKivy
This is basically a very barebones note taking app made using Kivy. 

#### Required Dependencies
The only thing required apart from Python is the Kivy package. So within a virtual environment run : 
```bash
sudo apt install python3-kivy   #For Python 3.x
```

#### Running
This can be run normally like any other Python program.
An APK can also be built for Android Devices using Bulldozer.
